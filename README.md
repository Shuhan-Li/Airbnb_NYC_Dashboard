# AirBnb_NYC Dashboard
## Introduction
This project delves into the analysis of Airbnb's vacation rental marketplace, focusing on listings across New York City's five boroughs. Leveraging first-hand experience with Airbnb's services, our capstone team aimed to uncover insights from the platform's 2019 data. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, offers a comprehensive look at Airbnb's operations within NYC, providing a cleaned and reliable basis for our analysis.

## Data Overview
The dataset encompasses 48,895 unique listings, each characterized by 16 distinct features. These features range from basic listing identifiers like id and name to more intricate details such as neighborhood_group, room_type, and availability_365. Our analysis seeks to explore the dynamics of Airbnb's marketplace, focusing on aspects like pricing, listing types, and host activity.

## Methodology
Our approach involved rigorous data cleaning to ensure accuracy, followed by an analytical exploration of key variables. We utilized various graphical representations, including heat maps for spatial pricing trends, bar charts for comparing revenue across room types, time series analysis for revenue trends, and descriptive statistics for a market snapshot.
